### Karim, Mathieu, Ruan

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(vegan)
library(vegan3d)
library(mgcv)
library(MASS)
library(rgl)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
eddata <- read.csv("Global_Education.csv")
```

## Question 2
```{r}

#selecting columns we want to observe 
eddata2 <- eddata[ ,c("Gross_Primary_Education_Enrollment", "Gross_Tertiary_Education_Enrollment" , "Unemployment_Rate", "Birth_Rate", "OOSR_Upper_Secondary_Age_Male","OOSR_Upper_Secondary_Age_Female", "Youth_15_24_Literacy_Rate_Male", "Youth_15_24_Literacy_Rate_Female")]

#correlation matrix 
round(cor(eddata2),2)
```
* We observe one strong relationship—namely, the relationship between Out of School Rate (OOSR) for upper-secondary-age males and females. This is interesting in exploring questions of gender inequality compared to broader educational development. There seems to be moderately strong relationships with OOSR for females and birth rate, perhaps suggesting that as there are more children being born, you find less female enrollment in school. Unemployment rate is also strikingly uncorrelated to any of the other measurements. This is fairly surprising, but can perhaps be explained by the pervasiveness of manual labor that does not require extended educational resources.

## Question 3
```{r}
paf(as.matrix(eddata2))$KMO

KMO(as.matrix(WB2))

```

Off the bat given how low the majprity of the correlations are within the correlation matrix we are wary of how well suited our data is for factor analysis. While there are some exceptions the majority of correlations range from around +/- 0.1-0.4. With over 200 rows the size of our data is fine to do factor analysis with, although more entries would make for more robust results, but we are obviously limited by how many countries exist. Finally we are hopeful in our ability to identify underlying latent factors as we are considering 

**talk about kmo when we can run it lol**

## Question 4: Use Principal Components (or appropriate option in Factor Analysis) to decide on a number of latent factors. You can use Scree Plot, eigenvalue>1, or parallel analysis

```{r}

(pc1 <- princomp(eddata2, cor = TRUE))

screeplot(pc1, type = "lines", col = "red", lwd = 2, pch = 19, cex = 1.2,  main = "Scree Plot of Raw WB Data")


```
If we utilize the eigenvalue greater than 1 method we can estimate that there are around three latent factors that properly explain the variability of our data. This aligns with the scree plot as we see an elbow at four components, telling us to cut off at around 3. 


##Question 5: Perform a series of factor analyses using orthogonal models. First, try at least two extraction methods (choose from Principal Components, Principle Axis Factoring, Iterative PCA or iterative PAF, Maximum Likelihood). Use some method for comparing extraction methods to choose a ‘best’ method (i.e. RMSR or # residuals greater than .05).
```{r}

#Maximum Likelihood w/ 2 Factor Solution 

fact0 <- factanal(eddata2, factors = 2, rotation = "varimax")
fact0

fact1 <- factanal(eddata2, factors = 3, rotation = "varimax")
fact1

#get reproduced correlation matrix
repro1 <- fact1$loadings%*%t(fact1$loadings)

#residual correlation matrix
resid1 <- fact1$cor - repro1
round(resid1, 2)

len <- length(resid1[upper.tri(resid1)])
(RMSR1 <- sqrt(sum(resid1[upper.tri(resid1)]^2)/len))

#get proportion of residuals greater than 0.05 in absolute value
paste0(round(sum(rep(1, len)[abs(resid1[upper.tri(resid1)])>0.05])/len*100),"%")



#PAF 

fact2 <- fa(eddata2, nfactors = 3, rotate = "varimax", fm = "pa")
fact2

#get reproduced correlation matrix
repro2 <- fact2$loadings%*%t(fact2$loadings)
#residual correlation matrix
resid2 <- cor(eddata2)-repro2
round(resid2, 2)

#get root-mean squared residuals - already provided in output actually
len <- length(resid2[upper.tri(resid2)])
(RMSR2 <- sqrt(sum(resid2[upper.tri(resid2)]^2)/len))

#get proportion of residuals greater than 0.05 in absolute value
paste0(round(sum(rep(1, len)[abs(resid2[upper.tri(resid2)])>0.05])/len*100),"%")



#Iterative PCA 

fact3 <- fa(eddata2, nfactors = 3, rotate = "varimax", SMC = FALSE, fm = "pa")
fact3

#get reproduced correlation matrix
repro3 <- fact3$loadings%*%t(fact3$loadings)
#residual correlation matrix
resid3 <- cor(eddata2)-repro3
round(resid3, 2)

#get root-mean squared residuals - again, in output above
len <- length(resid3[upper.tri(resid3)])
RMSR3 <- sqrt(sum(resid3[upper.tri(resid3)]^2)/len)
RMSR3

#get proportion of residuals greater than 0.05 in absolute value
paste0(round(sum(rep(1, len)[abs(resid3[upper.tri(resid3)])>0.05])/len*100),"%")

```

In doing maximum likelihood analysis we found first after testing with two and three factors that neither were  sufficient in explaining our data with very low p-values where we rejected the nul hypothesis that 2/3 factors would properly explain our data. Utilzing the 3 factor analysis, nonetheless, as it had a greater p-value and aligned with our PCA we then found that around 11% of the residuals were greater than 0.05 and that the RMSR was around 0.085. It is important to note, however, that of the residuals above 0.05 they were often far over that limit reaching sometimes a value of 0.9, which makes us even more wary of to what extent maximum likelihood analysis can explain our data. 


##Question 6: Once you’ve chosen an extraction method, try a varimax and/or a quartimax rotation. Pick one of these rotations and discuss the interpretation of the final factors. Make one or more loading plots as appropriate.
Note: a loading plot may aid in deciding which variables load more heavily on which variables.
```{r}
